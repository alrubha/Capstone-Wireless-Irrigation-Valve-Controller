# Capstone-Wireless-Irrigation-Valve-Controller
2018 ECE senior design project at Oregon State University for Team 16. 
The code is for avr atmega328 microcontroller and it can be used for other avr microcontroller with few modifications. It uses SPI to communicate with NRF24L01+ to establish wireless communications and control electric irrigation valves with DC solonoid. This code is a part of a Capstone project.
